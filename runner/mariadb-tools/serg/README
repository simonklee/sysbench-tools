run_gdb
^^^^^^^
A wrapper that can run any executable under gdb.  useful for debugging mysqld
bootstrap (before mtr learned to do that) and to debug
mysql,mysqldump,mysqlbinlog,etc that are run from inside *.test files.

Use as

  run_gdb <path-to-executable>

it'll rename executable to <old-name>.exe and put a symlink to itself
under the old executable name. When run as this executable it'll
start gdb in xterm.

thou_shalt_not_kill.pm
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A perl module that prevents killing of subprocesses. Useful to prevent
mysql-test-run from kill -9 your gdb session and from killing mysqld too
early, before it has finished the logging or whatever.

Use as

  perl -Mthou_shalt_not_kill ./mtr sometest

When mtr will try to kill something, you will see what it's trying to
kill and you'll be able to approve or cancel the killing action.

y.output-to-html
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Converts bison output file (from bison --verbose) to a huge html file,
that takes quite a while to load, but then one can navigate the grammar
with a comfort of a browser.
